# Send me your position

A shortcode that adds a button that allows your visitors to send to you their position via WhatsApp (using [wa.me](https://wa.me)).

## Why... and how it works

Have to go to your not much technology-savvy customer?
Point her/him to the page where the shortcode lives (maybe using a smartphone :-).
They will be guided through WhatsApp API to send you a message with a Google Maps link.

## Usage
```
[smyp wa="+1 555 4567" askname=1]button text[/smyp]
```
- Enclose the message you want to show in the shortcode.
- **Specify your phone number** in international format with "wa" parameter.
- Set askname=0 if you don't want the plugin to ask their name

## GDPR
The plugin doesn't collect *ANY* information.

## What it does not does not do
- Open in a new window (that's for prevent Chrome to block like a popup).
- Send the message via WhatsApp. It only prepares it.
- Deal with WhatsApp Business API.

## Styling
Personalize your button with these CSS selectors

| selector                   | function                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------|
| `.smyp-container`          | for the main container      |
| `.smyp-button`             | for the button itself       |
| `.smyp-button-wa:before`   | for the WhatsApp icon       |
| ` #smyp-message`           | for the message container   |
| `.smyp-warn`               | for warning messages        |
| `.smyp-error`              | for error messages          |

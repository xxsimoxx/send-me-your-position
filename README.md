# Send me your position

A shortcode that adds a button that allows your visitors to send to you their position via WhatsApp.

## Why... and how it works

Have to go to your not much technology-savvy customer?
Point her/him to the page where the shortcode lives (maybe using a smartphone :-).
They will be guided through WhatsApp API to send you a message with a Google Maps link.

## Usage
```
[smyp wa="+1 555 4567" askname=1]button text[/smyp]
```
- Enclose the message you want to show in the shortcode.
- **Specify your phone number** in international format.
- Set askname=0 if you don't want the plugin to ask their name
